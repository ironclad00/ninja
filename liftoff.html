							<p>Liftoff Music Company is a music-related crowdfunding startup founded by myself in the fall of 2013. It emerged from my semester at Gainesville's <a href="www.hackerhouse.info">HackerHouse</a>, a tech-oriented startup incubator/talent cultivator led by Agapitus Lye of Trendy Entertainment.</p>
							<p>The core of Liftoff consists of a crowdfunding platform (CFP) aimed at musicians and musical performance groups that are new and trying to get noticed by labels or are trying to make a living independently of labels (indie). The MVP focuses only on a platform for funding tours. </p>
							<p>As of the summer of 2014, I have stopped all work on Liftoff. As much as I regret doing so, I feel that pursuing Liftoff further would put my degree in jeopardy due to the time and commitment that comes with aquiring VC funding. I've documented the progress my team and I made with Liftoff since HackerHouse ended below.</p>

				<h2 id="innovation">Innovation</h2>
					<p>The innovative concepts Liftoff hoped to introduce to the current crowdfunding model are platform specialization, gamification, and increased community involvement.</p>
					<h3>Platform Specialization</h3>
						<p>General-purpose crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo are powerful because of the massive community they foster due to the fact that they are general purpose and thus have greater site traffic, among other reasons. However, my team and I believe that it is possible for specialty platforms to exist within the industry. This assumption is based on the fact that, given the broad range of campaign types that juggernaughts like Kickstarter can host, general-purpose platforms don't have the resources to customize and cater specifically to each campaign type.</p>
						<p>This specialization can take many different forms. One of the changes Liftoff felt necessary to make was the presentation of a campaign's status. Most CFP designs place emphasis on displaying a campaign's remaining time, amount funded, funding goal, and promotional video. While these aspects are definitely important, a potential contributor needs more info than that to become interested in a tour, especially if the band/artist is new and/or not well-known. Location, specifically, is incredibly important. The two widgets below are included on every campaign page and campaign preview (when a user is browsing campaigns) and designed to quickly inform users about a campaign's geographic info.</p>
						<div class="row" id="widgets">
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<div id="gauge"></div>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<img id="map" class="img-responsive" src="images/liftoff/map.svg"/>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p class="caption">Prototype widgets for quickly communicating a campaign's status and info to a potential contributor.</p>
						<p>There are many other ways to specialize a CFP. Some involve the ability to exclusively focus advertising and analytical efforts on promoting and improving specific types of campaigns; others involve catering to needs that campaign creators are almost guaranteed to have, such as needing to manufacture and distribute merchandise for tours. These specializations are discussed in greater detail in the <a href="#plan">business plan</a>.</p>
					<h3>Gamification</h3>
						<p>Liftoff introduces a badge/achievement system whose purpose is to reward users for involvement. These badges are displayed on a user's profile and can be viewed by other users like trophies. The more involved the task is, the more the badge for completing said task should stand out visually. This creates a "wow factor" for someone who encounters a user who is heavily involved in the community and thus provides a greater incentive to be a part of the community.</p>

					<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
						<p>Like any good CFP, Liftoff needs to be able to foster and maintain a community. Otherwise, artists may as well stick to using their own personal networks for raising funds.</p>
						<p>Liftoff's attempt at strengthening our community is through the use of a forum (intended to be custom-build but is currently hosted on a third-party site for the MVP) and through the "Connections" tab on each campaign page. These features are necessary because every tour needs a lot more than just funds. The best example of this is the need for artists to find places to sleep since hotel costs are usually prohibitive. In order to couch surf or get help with minor aspects like assistance unloading the truck before a show, artists can use the forums and the Connections features to get in touch with users on a local level.</p>
				<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
					<p>For the sake of showcasing my design, I've included all the files from Liftoff's development <a href="liftoffmvp/templates/index" target="_blank">here</a>. These are only front-end files and have no functionality. Also, the front-end is only partially finished, so many links and features won't work, aren't complete, or lead to empty pages. It is unlikely that I will fix any bugs or add to these pages unless I resume work on Liftoff.</p>
				<h2 id="plan">Business Plan</h2>
					<p>At the end of HackerHouse, Liftoff registered to compete in the UF Big Idea Business Plan Competition. The competiton began with the start of Spring 2014 classes and ended at the end of April. The purpose of this competition was to help guide and educate UF students with innovative and/or profitable business ideas via the creation of a business plan. This plan was then judged by experienced entrepreneurs and awarded the following prizes: 1st place, $25,000; 2nd place, $10,000; 3rd place, $5,000.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, Liftoff did not place in the top three teams, but nonetheless, we gained a much greater understanding of the intricacies of business. A sample of the plan, which includes the executive summary and the industry overview, can be downloaded here.
